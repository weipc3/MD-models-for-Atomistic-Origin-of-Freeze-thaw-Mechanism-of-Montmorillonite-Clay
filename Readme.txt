01-initial-Mt-ice-model.data: This is initial Mt-ice model, as shown in Figure 2.
02-Equi.1-for-100ns-at-270k.data: This is Mt-water-ice model after energy minimization and Equi. 1 for 100 ns at 270 K.
03-Mt-water-ice-system-at-230K.data: This model was obtained after cooling process (270 ~ 230 K) for 200 ns, as shown in Figure 6(b).
04-bulk-ice-model.data: This is bulk ice system, as shown in Figure 18(a).
05-water-ice-vacuum-without-Mt.data: This is water-ice system with montmorillonite, containing upper and lower vacuum, as shown in Figure 18(b).
